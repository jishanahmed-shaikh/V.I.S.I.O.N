# V.I.S.I.O.N
V.I.S.I.O.N - Video Interpolation &amp; Super-Resolution  for Intelligent Optimization in Neural Processing


This is a work in progress project... so bear with me till I have everything in order. 
Note that I am primarily working on optimization of the pipeline. 

The credit for Real ESRGAN (Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Netwrork) goes to the owners(s) of the following repository:

The credit for RIFE (Real Time Intermediate Flow Estimation) goes to the owner(s) od the following repository:
https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE

I will try my best to upload everything in such a manner that this becomes a quick download and run project along with all necessary and generalized Documentation!
Along with any issues that I faced in the time I built this project.

If anyone has any issues. You may reach out to me at: kaiser.mn2003@gmail.com
